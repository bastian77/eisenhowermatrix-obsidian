### Matrix Quadrants

The Eisenhower Matrix organizes tasks into four quadrants:

- **Q1 (Urgent & Important)**: Do these tasks immediately
- **Q2 (Not Urgent & Important)**: Schedule time for these tasks
- **Q3 (Urgent & Not Important)**: Delegate these if possible
- **Q4 (Not Urgent & Not Important)**: Consider eliminating these tasks

## Configuration

Priority Note specific settings is where you can specify individual note settings.

### Scan Settings

- **Include folder**: Vault-relative path to scan for `#TODO` notes (default: `/` for entire vault)
- **Recursive scan**: Enable to scan subfolders of the include folder
- **Task detection**: Any unchecked Markdown task (`- [ ]`, `* [ ]`, `+ [ ]`, or numbered equivalents) is detected automatically
- **Max files to scan**: Limit the number of files to scan (set to `0` for unlimited)

### Behavior Settings

- **Auto-remove TODO on Done**: Remove the `#TODO` tag when a task is moved to Done (instead of strikethrough)
- **Strikethrough TODO on Done**: Replace `#TODO` with `~~#TODO~~` when moved to Done (disabled if auto-remove is enabled)

## Requirements

- Obsidian v1.2.3 or higher
- No additional dependencies required

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Appearing

- Ensure your tasks use an unchecked Markdown checkbox such as `- [ ] Task name`
- Check that the **Include folder** setting includes the path where your TODO notes are located
- Verify that **Recursive scan** is enabled if your TODOs are in subfolders
- Check the **Max files to scan** setting isn't limiting the scan
- Make sure property [do-not-delete:priority-matrix-plugin] has not been removed

### Matrix View Not Opening

- Files with "priority matrix" in the name will automatically open in matrix view
- Ensure the file contains a priority matrix code block or frontmatter

### Plugin Not Loading

- Verify the plugin is enabled in **Settings** → **Community plugins**
- Check that `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` are in the correct folder: `.obsidian/plugins/priority-matrix/`
- Try reloading Obsidian (`Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R`)
